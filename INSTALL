Dependencies:

  You must have the shared CUDD >= 2.4.1 library ("--enable-shared" option)
  installed at the default location /usr/local/lib, or at the location
  specified by the CUDD_DIR environment variable.

  gcc 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or above.

Installation Instructions for STACCATO:

  To change the static/shared library type, use the make parameter:
  BUILD_TYPE=shared or BUILD_TYPE=static (static by default).
  You must specify the path to the CUDD sources directory with:
  CUDD_INCLUDE=example/path/to/cudd.

  Example for building shared library:
  $> make BUILD_TYPE=shared CUDD_INCLUDE=example/path/to/cudd

  Example for building static library:
  $> make CUDD_INCLUDE=example/path/to/cudd

  You can test static library with:
  $> make test CUDD_INCLUDE=example/path/to/cudd
  $> ./sample

  The author says that "Dynamic resizing of structures and garbage
  collection is still premature in its functionality", so you can
  disable them by passing additional parameters:
  $> SM="-DDISABLE_SM"
  $> GC="-DDISABLE_GC"

  To clean created files use:
  $> make clean
